features:
  - title: Extremely Developer Focus
    details: Minimal local development setup & highly efficient CI/CD pipeline with monorepo structure helps you focus on developing instead of infrastructure. There's no sacrifice of developer experience regardless of the level of granularity of your Microfrontends project.
  - title: Excellent User Experience
    details: With highly configurable module sharing technology, the shared modules across the sub-applications will be hosted by the shell and only be built and downloaded once, user experience will not be impacted by using Microfrontends architecture style.
  - title: Highly Scalable Workflow
    details: Regardless of how MANY sub-applications your project is divided into, you can manage them in one place. Eliminates the manual maintenance between shell and sub-applications. Once shared code is changed, all affected sub-applications can be released in one click.
